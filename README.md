## Building a 16bits computer using logical gates. 
I am building a 16bits computer from logic gates. Notably NAND gates.
This is part of a course called nand to tetris (that I am following online).
And I am using the book CODE by charles Petzold as a reference and a guide. 


# Note: I coded the gates using hdl. And ran them on a hardware simulator program that executes hdl.
step1:
Given a Nand gate, I built Not, And, Or, Xor, Mux, DMux, Not16, And16, Or16, Mux16, Or8Way, Mux4Way16, Mux8Way16, DMux4Way, DMux8Way gates.
